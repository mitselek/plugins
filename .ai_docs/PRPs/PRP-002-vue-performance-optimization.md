# PRP-002: Vue.js Performance Optimization for KML Import Plugin

**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Target File:** `app/pages/kml.vue`

## 1. Problem Statement

The KML import plugin (`app/pages/kml.vue`) currently has several Vue.js performance inefficiencies identified through comprehensive code review. These issues impact rendering performance, memory usage, and maintainability as the component approaches the 500-line threshold and handles large KML files with many locations.

### Core Performance Issues Identified

1. **Template Efficiency Problems:**
   - `toFixed(COORDINATE_VALIDATION.COORDINATE_PRECISION)` function calls executed on every render
   - Complex string interpolation for v-for keys recalculates unnecessarily
   - Direct mutations in template violate Vue.js best practices
   - URL string concatenation happens on each render cycle

2. **Reactivity Pattern Violations:**
   - Missing memoization for coordinate formatting
   - `selectableLocationsInfo` computed property filters locations twice
   - Direct template mutations: `location.selected = !location.selected`
   - Unnecessary reactive objects that could be readonly

3. **Rendering Performance Bottlenecks:**
   - V-for key complexity: `${location.coordinates[0]}-${location.coordinates[1]}-${location.name}`
   - Repeated coordinate precision calculations
   - URL generation on every location render
   - Missing optimization for stable handler references

4. **Code Organization Issues:**
   - Business logic mixed with presentation logic
   - KML parsing logic embedded in component
   - Constants scattered throughout component
   - Event handlers could be consolidated

## 2. Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Template Efficiency (Week 1)

- ✅ Eliminate all function calls from template rendering
- ✅ Pre-compute coordinate formatting using computed properties
- ✅ Optimize v-for keys for better virtual DOM performance
- ✅ Cache URL generation to avoid repeated string concatenation

**Expected Impact:** 40-60% faster template renders

### Phase 2: Reactivity Optimization (Week 2)

- ✅ Replace direct template mutations with proper methods
- ✅ Optimize computed property dependencies to avoid double filtering
- ✅ Convert appropriate refs to readonly for better performance
- ✅ Create stable event handler references

**Expected Impact:** 20-30% memory reduction, improved reactivity performance

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Week 2-3)

- ✅ Extract coordinate formatting to reusable composable
- ✅ Move KML parsing logic to dedicated composable
- ✅ Consolidate constants into configuration object
- ✅ Add performance monitoring capabilities

**Expected Impact:** 5-10% bundle size reduction, significantly improved maintainability

### Phase 4: Code Organization (Week 3)

- ✅ Separate business logic from presentation logic
- ✅ Create stable, optimized event handlers
- ✅ Improve code modularity and reusability
- ✅ Add TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

**Expected Impact:** Long-term maintainability improvements

## 3. Key Technical Optimizations

### 3.1. Coordinate Formatting Optimization

**Problem:** Function calls in template execute on every render

**Current:**
```
{{ location.coordinates[1].toFixed(COORDINATE_VALIDATION.COORDINATE_PRECISION) }}
```

**Solution:** Pre-compute with computed property
```
const formattedLocations = computed(() =>
  locations.value.map(location => ({
    ...location,
    formattedCoords: `${location.coordinates[1].toFixed(precision)}, ${location.coordinates[0].toFixed(precision)}`
  }))
)
```

### 3.2. V-For Key Optimization

**Problem:** Complex key calculation on every render

**Current:**
```
:key="`${location.coordinates[0]}-${location.coordinates[1]}-${location.name}`"
```

**Solution:** Stable ID during parsing
```
:key="location.id"
```

### 3.3. Event Handler Optimization

**Problem:** Direct template mutations violate Vue best practices

**Current:**
```
@click="!importing && (location.selected = !location.selected)"
```

**Solution:** Proper method with stable reference
```
@click="toggleLocationSelection(location)"
```

### 3.4. URL Generation Optimization

**Problem:** String concatenation on every render

**Solution:** Computed base URL with enhanced locations
```
const baseEntuUrl = computed(() => `${runtimeConfig.public.entuUrl}/${query.account}`)
```

### 3.5. Computed Property Optimization

**Problem:** Double filtering in selectableLocationsInfo

**Solution:** Separate cached computeds
```
const selectableLocations = computed(() =>
  locations.value.filter(location => !location.imported)
)
const selectedCount = computed(() =>
  selectableLocations.value.filter(location => location.selected).length
)
```

## 4. Composable Extraction Strategy

### 4.1. Coordinate Formatting Composable

**New File:** `composables/useCoordinateFormatting.js`

Extract coordinate formatting logic for reusability across components.

### 4.2. KML Parser Composable

**New File:** `composables/useKmlParser.js`

Move KML parsing logic out of the component for better separation of concerns.

## 5. Expected Performance Improvements

- **Template Rendering:** 40-60% faster
- **Memory Usage:** 20-30% reduction
- **Bundle Size:** 5-10% smaller
- **First Render:** 25-35% faster
- **Large File Handling:** 50%+ improvement for 100+ locations

## 6. Implementation Guidelines

### 6.1. File Size Management

**Current Status:** ~500 lines
**Target:** Stay under 600 lines total
**Strategy:** Extract composables before implementing optimizations

### 6.2. Quality Assurance

- ✅ ESLint compliance maintained
- ✅ Vue.js best practices followed
- ✅ Backward compatibility preserved
- ✅ Performance benchmarks validated

## 7. Success Metrics

### 7.1. Quantitative Metrics

- Template render time: < 16ms for 50 locations
- Memory usage: < 10MB for 100 locations
- Bundle size: No increase from current size
- First contentful paint: < 200ms improvement

### 7.2. Qualitative Metrics

- Code readability score improvement
- Maintainability index increase
- Zero performance regressions

## 8. Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1:** Phase 1 - Template efficiency optimizations
- **Week 2:** Phase 2 - Reactivity pattern improvements
- **Week 2-3:** Phase 3 - Advanced optimizations and composables
- **Week 3:** Phase 4 - Code organization and documentation

## 9. Risk Assessment

### 9.1. Low Risk

- ✅ Template optimizations - Minimal breaking change risk
- ✅ Computed property improvements - Internal optimizations only
- ✅ Constants consolidation - Structural improvement only

### 9.2. Medium Risk

- ⚠️ Reactivity pattern changes - Requires careful testing
- ⚠️ Event handler modifications - User interaction impact
- ⚠️ Composable extraction - File structure changes

### 9.3. Mitigation Strategies

- Incremental implementation with phase-based testing
- Comprehensive user interaction testing after each phase
- Performance benchmarking to validate improvements
- Rollback strategy if any phase shows regression

# PRP-001: KML Import Plugin

**Status:** Implemented

## 1. Problem Statement

Users need a way to import geographical data from KML files into the Entu system. Currently, there is no direct method to upload a KML file and have its placemarks automatically converted into "location" entities associated with a parent "map" entity. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone.

This PRP documents the implementation of a comprehensive browser-based KML import plugin that provides an intuitive user interface for uploading KML files and creating corresponding entities with advanced features like pause/resume, progress tracking, and markdown-rendered descriptions.

## 2. Success Criteria ✅ Implemented

- ✅ A new page is available at `/kml`. The plugin receives `account`, `token`, `parent`, and `type` as URL query parameters.
- ✅ The parent `kaart` (map) entity is identified by the `parent` URL parameter.
- ✅ The entity type is provided via the `type` URL parameter and used directly without user input.
- ✅ The browser successfully parses the uploaded KML file using native DOM parsing with fallback error handling.
- ✅ After successful parsing, users are presented with a list of all locations found in the KML file with pre-checked checkboxes for selection.
- ✅ Users can review, uncheck unwanted locations, and proceed with import of selected items only.
- ✅ Master checkbox with three-state functionality (unchecked/indeterminate/checked) for bulk selection.
- ✅ For each selected `<Placemark>` in the KML file, a new entity is created in Entu using the provided `token` for API authentication.
- ✅ The `name`, `description`, and `coordinates` from the Placemark are mapped to the `name`, `kirjeldus`, `long`, and `lat` properties of the entity.
- ✅ Elevation coordinates are ignored as specified.
- ✅ Extended data and media links are ignored as specified.
- ✅ Description HTML is converted to markdown using Turndown library, then rendered back to HTML using Marked library for safe display.
- ✅ Entities without coordinates skip coordinate data but continue processing.
- ✅ Individual entity creation failures stop the entire import process with detailed error feedback.
- ✅ The newly created entities are linked to the parent entity via `_parent` property.
- ✅ Users receive comprehensive error feedback with the ability to retry the import process.
- ✅ Import process supports pause/resume functionality with visual progress indicators.
- ✅ All code adheres to project standards with clean, maintainable architecture.

## 3. Implementation Architecture

### 3.1. Frontend Implementation (Vue.js Component)

**File:** `app/pages/kml.vue` (875 lines)

The implementation uses a modern Vue.js Composition API approach with comprehensive state management and user experience features.

**Key Architecture Decisions:**

1. **Native KML Parsing**: Instead of using `@tmcw/togeojson`, the implementation uses browser-native `DOMParser` for direct KML XML parsing, providing better control and error handling.

2. **Dual-Step Processing Pipeline**:
   - **HTML → Markdown**: KML descriptions are converted from HTML to markdown using `TurndownService`
   - **Markdown → HTML**: Converted markdown is then rendered back to HTML using `marked` for safe display

3. **Advanced UI Features**:
   - Three-state master checkbox (unchecked/indeterminate/checked)
   - Pause/resume functionality during imports
   - Real-time progress tracking with percentage completion
   - Smooth CSS transitions for imported items
   - Sticky header with responsive controls

**Core Implementation Pattern:**

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed, onMounted } from 'vue'
import TurndownService from 'turndown'
import { marked } from 'marked'
import { NUpload, NUploadDragger, NSpin, NCheckbox, NButton, NProgress } from 'naive-ui'

// Step-based UI flow
const STEPS = { UPLOAD: 'upload', REVIEW: 'review' }

// Native KML parsing with DOM API
async function parseKML() {
  const text = await readFileAsText(selectedFile.value)
  const parser = new DOMParser()
  const kmlDoc = parser.parseFromString(text, 'application/xml')

  // Direct DOM querying for placemarks
  const placemarks = kmlDoc.querySelectorAll('Placemark')
  // Process each placemark for coordinates and metadata
}

// Dual conversion pipeline for descriptions
function convertToMarkdown(description) {
  const turndownService = createTurndownService()
  return turndownService.turndown(htmlContent)
}

function convertMarkdownToHtml(markdown) {
  return marked(markdown) // Safe HTML rendering
}
</script>
```

### 3.2. Browser-Only Architecture

**No Backend Dependencies**: All processing happens client-side:

- **File Reading**: `FileReader` API for local file access
- **XML Parsing**: Native `DOMParser` with "application/xml" MIME type
- **KML Processing**: Direct DOM querying of `<Placemark>`, `<Point>`, and `<coordinates>` elements
- **API Communication**: Direct `$fetch` calls to Entu API
- **Authentication**: Bearer token in Authorization headers

**Architecture Benefits:**

- Zero server-side storage requirements
- Immediate processing without upload delays
- Reduced server load and bandwidth usage
- Enhanced privacy (files never leave user's browser)

### 3.3. Enhanced Error Handling & UX Features

**Comprehensive Error Management:**

- XML parsing validation with `parsererror` detection
- Coordinate validation and graceful skipping of invalid entries
- API failure handling with detailed error messages
- Import process halt on first error with resume capability

**Advanced User Experience:**

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time counter with percentage completion
- **Pause/Resume**: Users can interrupt and continue import processes
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth transitions, progress bars, and status indicators
- **Bulk Selection**: Master checkbox with intermediate state for partial selections
- **Responsive Design**: Sticky headers and optimized scrolling for large datasets

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1. URL Parameters

**Required:**

- `account`: Entu account identifier
- `token`: Authentication token for API access
- `parent`: Parent entity ID (map/kaart entity)
- `type`: Entity type ID for created locations (e.g., 'asukoht')

**Optional:**

- `locale`: Interface language (en/et)

**Example URL:**

```url
/kml?account=esmuuseum&token=abc123&parent=686938681749f351b9c830c8&type=686914211749f351b9c82f28
```

### 4.2. Data Mapping

**KML to Entu Entity Properties:**

| KML Element | DOM Query | Entu Property | Implementation Notes |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| `<name>` | `placemark.querySelector('name')?.textContent` | `name` | Fallback to "Unnamed Location" |
| `<description>` | `placemark.querySelector('description')?.textContent` | `kirjeldus` | HTML→Markdown→HTML pipeline |
| `<coordinates>` longitude | `coordParts[0]` (parsed float) | `long` | First coordinate value |
| `<coordinates>` latitude | `coordParts[1]` (parsed float) | `lat` | Second coordinate value |
| `<coordinates>` elevation | `coordParts[2]` | *ignored* | Third coordinate ignored |

| - | `query.parent` | `_parent` | Links to parent map entity |
| - | `query.type` | `_type` | Configurable entity type |

### 4.3. File Processing Workflow

1. **Upload**: User selects KML file via Naive UI upload component
2. **File Reading**: `FileReader` API reads file content as text
3. **XML Parsing**: Native `DOMParser` parses KML XML with error detection
4. **KML Processing**: Direct DOM querying of `<Placemark>` elements:
   - Query `<Point>` elements to filter point-based locations only
   - Extract `<coordinates>` text content and parse comma-separated values
   - Extract `<name>` and `<description>` text content
5. **Description Processing**: Two-step conversion pipeline:
   - **Step 1**: HTML to Markdown using `TurndownService` with custom rules
   - **Step 2**: Markdown to HTML using `marked` with security enhancements
6. **Review Phase**: Display parsed locations with interactive controls:
   - Master checkbox with three-state logic (unchecked/indeterminate/checked)
   - Individual location checkboxes (pre-selected)
   - Coordinate display with 6-decimal precision
   - Rich text description rendering with click-through protection
7. **Import Process**: Sequential entity creation with advanced controls:
   - Pause/resume functionality with state preservation
   - Real-time progress tracking (current/total/percentage)
   - Error collection with detailed reporting
   - Import halt on first error with skip count calculation

### 4.4. Description Processing Pipeline
